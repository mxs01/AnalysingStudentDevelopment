# Analysing Student Development

This project utilizes a Vector Autorregressive Model (VAR) to predict the amount of students enrolled at the [University of TÃ¼bingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de) for specified courses, based on three different time-series datasets:
- [past enrolled students](https://uni-tuebingen.de/einrichtungen/verwaltung/iv-studierende/studierendenabteilung/statistiken/) at Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen
- [salary expectations](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis//online?operation=table&code=62321-0001&bypass=true&levelindex=0&levelid=1702307320529#abreadcrumb) in certain sectors
- [high-school graduates in BW](https://www.statistik-bw.de/BildungKultur/SchulenAllgem/LRt0302.jsp)

## Get started
### Overview
The project uses the following structure.
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ dat

â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ conda_env.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ install_env.sh
â””â”€â”€ run_notebooks.py
```

### Installation
To get started follow these steps:
#### 1. Install conda
This project uses [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) as the package manager. Make sure you have conda installed on your system.
You can verify that by running `conda -V` in your terminal. It should print your current version installed.
```sh
conda -V
```
```sh
conda 23.11.0
```
If the comand fails, please install conda using this [guide](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation).


#### 2. Install environment
To set up the environment needed, run the `install_env.sh` script in your terminal. This process can take a while.
When the script finishes you should see this in your terminal.
```sh
./install_env.sh
```
```sh
...
done
#
# To activate this environment, use
#
#     $ conda activate data_literacy
#
# To deactivate an active environment, use
#
#     $ conda deactivate
```

#### 3. Activate environment
All that's left is activating the environment.
```sh
conda activate data_literacy
```
That's it. You are all set now ðŸš€.

#### Notes
To deactivate the environemnt, use: `conda deactivate`.

If you want to delete the added conda environment from your system, you can run `conda remove -n data_literacy --all`.

`conda env list` lists all your environments. Note the `*` symbol next to the currently active env.

## Experiments
- Exp 1 - Regression: Build the VAR model
- Exp 2 - Analyses: Look into properties of the computed model
- Exp 3 - Modifying data: What happens when there is sudden change in salray ecxpectations
- Exp 4 - Visualisation: Visualise computed parameters of the model


## The Paper
This project uses GitHub-Actions to compile the latest `paper.tex` file to a PDF.
### Big versions
If the commit message contains `[PDF]` the PDF gets compiled and added to the Project in a new commit. Look out for a commit message `Add PDF [skip-ci]`. If this is the latet commit, the PDF is up to date.
Otherwise read through the next section.

### Small increments
To see the PDF for the current commit navigate to the `Actions` tab. Select the `Create figures and create PDF` workflow. Click on the workflow run at the top, under `Artefacts` there is the PDF ready download.
